# Advent of Code 2025

Things have been so busy this year that I completely forgot about AoC until a coworker threw a message into Slack earlier today.  I'm so ashamed.

## Day 1 - Secret Entrance
Part 1 was cake walk.  Part 2 ruined me.  I wasn't handling edge cases properly and it took me forever to track it down and resolve it.  Off by one errors will forever be the bane of humanity.

## Day 2 - Gift Shop
This one was really easy.  Nice break from the pain of Day 1's part 2.  I had to refactor part 2 to use `long` instead of `int` but other than that it was straight forward.
